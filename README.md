For this week's homework, we were tasked with building an fully operational coding quiz game.

You will find 5 questions relating to coding where when you answer a question, it will flash whether it was right or wrong. 
Once the quiz has been finished, you will be able to submit your high score and see other scores.

I wanted to an retro gaming vibe to it.

We utilized skills including local storage, specifically hiding certain items so that the game will flow, and making sure that the questions and answers during the different stages were connecting correctly and reflecting.
